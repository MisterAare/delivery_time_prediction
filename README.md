# Food delivery time prediction

# Dataset:
The dataset is a cleaned version of the original dataset submitted by Gaurav Malik on Kaggle. Below are all the features in the dataset:

** ID: order ID number
** Delivery_person_ID: ID number of the delivery partner
** Delivery_person_Age: Age of the delivery partner
** Delivery_person_Ratings: ratings of the delivery partner based on past deliveries
** Restaurant_latitude: The latitude of the restaurant
** Restaurant_longitude: The longitude of the restaurant
** Delivery_location_latitude: The latitude of the delivery location
** Delivery_location_longitude: The longitude of the delivery location
** Type_of_order: The type of meal ordered by the customer
** Type_of_vehicle: The type of vehicle delivery partner rides
** Time_taken(min): The time taken by the delivery partner to complete the order


# Libraries and Frameworks

The Python libraries used in this project include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, plotly, pickle, Flask, and other related libraries for data manipulation, model building, visualization, and deployment.

# Data Analysis and Pre-processing

Model Building:
For this project I:

# Deployment:
The model was deployed on Google Colab IDE using the Flask framework and HTML for the user interface.

```python
from google.colab.output import eval_js
print(eval_js("google.colab.kernel.proxyPort(5000)"))
```
The below message in the Python shell is seen, which indicates that our App is now hosted and I can run it by clicking on the URL

```

Flask web application

```python
import numpy as np
from flask import Flask, request, render_template
import pickle

app = Flask(__name__, template_folder='/content/templates', static_folder='/content/static')
model = pickle.load(open('/content/model.pkl','rb'))

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template("index.html")

@app.route("/predict",methods = ["POST"])
def predict():
    Delivery_person_Age = int(request.form["Delivery_person_Age"])
    Delivery_person_Ratings = float(request.form["Delivery_person_Ratings"])
    distance = int(request.form["distance"])
    features = np.array([[Delivery_person_Age,Delivery_person_Ratings,distance]])

    prediction = model.predict(features)
    output = np.round(prediction[0], 2)
    return render_template('index.html', prediction_text='Predicted Delivery Time in Minutes = {}'.format(output))


if __name__=="__main__":
   app.run()
```
